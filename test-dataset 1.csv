5257,The staff where really friendly and the gentleman called Kenny was marvellous,
5258,"I saw a member of staff with what looked like our order and he realised that the 2 apple pies was missing and placed the try down on the side. I stood near the counter ,watching what was happening to the rest of the order for about 7 minutes before i grabbed the attention of another member of staff and pointed out that our food at been sat there for well over 5 minutes and i would not be eating the fries as they would be cold now. We were given fresh fries once the apple pies were ready but our burgers were cold and the frappe was all melted by the time we sat down to eat. We were also missing the 2 ketchup dips ordered so we just went to the self serve at this point because of the extra time taken to get our food and deal with the wait for things to be sorted. We only just made it to our cinema screening. We sat down to eat at 19:23",
